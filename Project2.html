            <hr>
            <p>The Sun is a massive, glowing sphere of hot plasma located at the center of our solar system. Composed primarily of hydrogen and helium, it serves as the primary source of energy for all life on Earth. Through nuclear fusion at its core, the Sun converts hydrogen into helium, releasing an enormous amount of energy in the form of light and heat. This energy radiates outward, affecting the entire solar system and driving climate, weather, and the cycles of life on our planet. As a G-type main-sequence star (G2V), the Sun has been shining for approximately 4.6 billion years.</p>

            <p>Beyond its vital role in sustaining life, the Sun exerts a powerful gravitational force that keeps the planets, asteroids, comets, and other celestial bodies in orbit. Its immense mass—accounting for more than 99.8% of the total mass of the solar system—creates a stable gravitational center. The Sun’s activity, including solar flares and coronal mass ejections, also influences space weather, which can impact satellites, communication systems, and power grids on Earth.</p>

            <p>Mercury is the smallest and innermost planet in our solar system, orbiting the Sun at an average distance of about 58 million kilometers (36 million miles). Despite being the closest planet to the Sun, it is not the hottest—Venus holds that title due to its thick atmosphere. Mercury has a rocky, barren surface covered with craters, ridges, and plains, resembling Earth's Moon. It has virtually no atmosphere to speak of, which causes dramatic temperature swings ranging from about -180°C (-290°F) at night to 430°C (800°F) during the day. Mercury’s small size and high </p>

Mercury’s small size and high density suggest it has a large iron core, which likely contributes to its weak magnetic field—one of the few terrestrial planets besides Earth to have one. Because it lacks a significant atmosphere, Mercury is constantly bombarded by solar radiation and micrometeoroids. The planet’s surface holds clues to the early formation of the solar system, making it a focus of interest for planetary scientists.</p>

            <hr>
            <p>Venus, the second planet from the Sun, is often called Earth's "sister planet" due to its similar size, mass, and composition. However, its environment is drastically different and far more hostile. Venus is shrouded in a dense atmosphere composed mainly of carbon dioxide, with clouds of sulfuric acid, creating an intense greenhouse effect that traps heat. This makes Venus the hottest planet in the solar system, with surface temperatures soaring above 460°C (860°F)—hot enough to melt lead. </p>

            <p>Venus rotates very slowly and in the opposite direction to most planets, including Earth, meaning the Sun rises in the west and sets in the east. One day on Venus (one full rotation) lasts longer than its year—about 243 Earth days compared to its 225-day orbit around the Sun. Despite these extremes, Venus has captivated scientists for decades. Its surface features include vast volcanic plains, towering mountains, and evidence of past tectonic activity.</p>

            <p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only known celestial body to support life. It has a unique combination of a breathable atmosphere, abundant liquid water, and a stable climate, all of which make it exceptionally well-suited for sustaining a diverse range of organisms. Earth's atmosphere is composed primarily of nitrogen and oxygen, providing essential gases for life and shielding the planet from harmful solar radiation through the ozone layer.

In addition to its physical characteristics, Earth has dynamic geological activity, including plate tectonics, which continuously reshapes its surface and contributes to the carbon cycle that stabilizes climate over long periods. Earth's single natural satellite, the Moon, helps moderate the planet's axial tilt, contributing to relatively stable seasons. Earth completes one orbit around the Sun in about 365.25 days and rotates on its axis every 24 hours, creating the cycle of day and night.</p>

            <p>Mars, the fourth planet from the Sun, is often called the "Red Planet" due to its reddish appearance, caused by iron oxide—commonly known as rust—on its surface. Slightly more than half the size of Earth, Mars has a thin atmosphere composed mostly of carbon dioxide, which provides little insulation or protection from solar radiation. As a result, surface temperatures are cold, often ranging from -125°C (-195°F) at the poles during winter to about 20°C (68°F) at the equator during the day.

Evidence gathered by orbiters, landers, and rovers—like NASA’s Curiosity and Perseverance—suggests that Mars once had liquid water on its surface and possibly conditions suitable for microbial life. The search for signs of past life and understanding Mars’ climate history are central goals of ongoing missions. With its relatively accessible terrain and proximity to Earth, Mars remains a focal point of scientific discovery and a symbol of humanity’s ambition beyond.</p>

Scientists are especially interested in Titan and Saturn's other icy moons like Enceladus, which sprays water vapor from its surface—possibly hinting at a hidden ocean below. With its strange storms, wild magnetic field, and mysterious interior, Saturn remains one of the most fascinating worlds out yonder in space. Saturn continues to captivate stargazers.</p>
